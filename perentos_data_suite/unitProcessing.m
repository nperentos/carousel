function unitProcessing(fileBase,varargin)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% unitProcessing umbrella function for unit processing, from phy curated output to trial-resolved
% spatial tuning curves.
% calls: getClusterProperties.m
%      : getTuningCurves.m (calls PFStability.m getMeanSpikePerPeriod.m permutePlaceRasters.m )
%      : selectClusters.m
% INPUT: fileBase
%        flag (1: continuous unidirectional (default), 2: cued direction and 3: passive) optional
%        pth: if not default path/folder structure then provide path to folder with data
%        verbose: to plot or not to plot
%        OUTPUT: fileBase.nq.mat - various cluster properties
%                fileBase.tun.mat - trial resolved tuning curves for the whole recording
%                fileBase.selectedClusters.mat - labels for selected clusters at a couple of acecptance.rejection criteria

function generateDLCpaths(full_path_to_spreadsheet)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% generateDLCpaths(full_path_to_spreadsheet) runs through a excel file that
% holds all the recording information and discovers sessions where video 
% data from the top position exists. It generates a txt file that holds all 
% the paths with these videos. The txt file is then used to run all videos 
% as a batch process through the DLC code.
